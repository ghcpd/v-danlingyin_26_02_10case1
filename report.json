      "description": "The RateLimitConfig interface defines the configuration object used to control rate limiting behavior. It was completely undocumented, with no explanation of its properties: maxRequests (the maximum request count per window) and windowMs (the duration of the rolling time window in milliseconds). This is a critical configuration type that consumers must understand to use the rate limiter correctly.",

While it had a brief inline comment, there was no documentation in the README explaining its parameters, return value, behavior, or usage examples.
